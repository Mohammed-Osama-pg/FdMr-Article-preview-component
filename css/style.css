Okay, I will provide examples of how to use the fluid-width function you defined in _mixins.scss.

The fluid-width function is designed to generate a CSS clamp value that allows a property (like font size, margin, or padding) to scale fluidly between two breakpoints. Let's break down how to use it with some examples.

*Understanding the Parameters

$size-min: The name of the smallest breakpoint (key in $breakpoints map).
$size-max: The name of the largest breakpoint (key in $breakpoints map).
$min-value: The value of the property at the smallest breakpoint (e.g., 16px).
$max-value: The value of the property at the largest breakpoint (e.g., 24px).
Assumptions

For these examples, let's assume your $breakpoints map looks something like this:
! $breakpoints: (
!   'sm': 576px,
!   'md': 768px,
!   'lg': 992px,
!   'xl': 1200px
! );

*Example 1: Fluid Font Size

Let's say you want a font size that scales between 16px at the sm breakpoint and 24px at the xl breakpoint.
!   @use 'path/to/mixins' as mixins; // Adjust the path to where your _mixins.scss file is located
!   .element {
!       font-size: mixins.fluid-width('sm', 'xl', 16px, 24px);
!       }


In this example:

We import the _mixins.scss file using @use. Make sure the path is correct.
We call the fluid-width function with the appropriate arguments. The result will be a clamp() value that the browser uses to determine the font size based on the viewport width.
The compiled CSS would look something like this (the exact values might be slightly different depending on the breakpoint values):

!   .element {
!      font-size: clamp(16px, calc(13.33333333px + 1.33333333vw), 24px);
!    }

Example 2: Fluid Margin
!   @use 'path/to/mixins' as mixins;

!   .container {
!     margin-left: mixins.fluid-width('md', 'lg', 10px, 20px);
!     margin-right: mixins.fluid-width('md', 'lg', 10px, 20px);
!   }

You can use this for any CSS property that accepts numeric values. For example, let's make the left and right margins of a container fluid:

This will generate CSS that makes the left and right margins scale between 10px at the md breakpoint and 20px at the lg breakpoint.

*Important Considerations

@use: Always remember to import the _mixins.scss file where you define the function using @use. The as mixins part is optional but recommended to avoid naming conflicts.
Units: Make sure your $min-value and $max-value have the same units (e.g., both in px, both in rem, etc.).
Breakpoint Names: The $size-min and $size-max parameters must match the keys you've defined in your $breakpoints map.
Path: Adjust the path to _mixins.scss according to your project structure. If style.scss and _mixins.scss are in the same directory, you can simply use @use '_mixins' as mixins;.
These examples should give you a good starting point for using the fluid-width function in your project. Remember to adjust the breakpoint names, values, and units to fit your specific design needs.
