#preview for the Article preview component:

## What's the challenge?
    My challenge is to build article preview component as close as design as possible, and using JavaScript to  initiate the share options when someone clicks the share icon.

## What are the requirements?
    The users should be able to: 
        - View the optimal layout for the component depending on their device's screen size.
        - See the social media share links when they click the share icon.

## Ideas to test myself:
    - Write the styles using a pre-processor, such as Sass.
    - Train my eye for detail by getting my solution as close to the design as I can.
    - Try estimating the time it will take for me to build the project. Then see if the time taken matches up to I estimate.
